YM FULL LEVELS
==============
One-shot pre-market levels tool combining:
- Session levels (pivots, overnight, prior week/month)
- Gamma levels (flip, call/put walls) from DIA options
- Confluence detector (where levels stack up)
- CSV export for NinjaTrader

FIXES IN THIS VERSION
---------------------
1. Spot is anchored to the reliable YM FUTURES price, not the DIA history
   close. On bad mornings dia.history() returned a garbage close (~471 vs a
   real ~527), which made the flip (47080) look "sane" because it was being
   compared against an equally-garbage spot. Now the futures price is the
   reference for BOTH the sanity guard and regime, so junk flips get dropped.
2. The DIA option chain is filtered to strikes within STRIKE_BAND of spot
   before computing GEX. Deep/stale strikes far from price were dragging the
   flip down toward 470; this removes them.
3. Regime PIVOT FALLBACK: when no valid gamma flip survives, regime is
   resolved from price vs the daily Pivot (above = POSITIVE, below = NEGATIVE)
   instead of writing UNKNOWN. This keeps the NinjaTrader stat buckets
   resolving (POS/NEG) on junk-options mornings so break/reject percentages
   still show. The regime source is noted in the console and is not gamma on
   those days.
4. find_flip() never returns None on non-empty data (closest-to-zero fallback),
   0DTE is detected by real days-to-expiry, and Regime/spot/timestamp meta rows
   are written to the CSV for the dashboard + logger.

#   WALL FREEZE — walls are a once-a-day number, flips are not
# ==========================================================
# A wall is an open-interest concentration, and OI is published overnight by the
# OCC and cannot change during the session. Re-deriving it every few minutes and
# weighting it by Black-Scholes gamma at live spot injects a spot-dependence into
# something that is static by nature, which is what makes the printed level step
# around during the day. So the walls are computed ONCE and held for the session,
# the way MenthorQ's getDailyLevels does it.
#
# The flip and the regime are deliberately NOT frozen. Their entire content is
# where price sits relative to the gamma profile *right now*; freezing them would
# throw away the only genuinely intraday-useful part of this.
#
# Note this stores the final YM-converted prices, not DIA strikes. Freezing the
# strike and re-converting each run would let the DIA->YM ratio drift move the
# level, defeating the point.
